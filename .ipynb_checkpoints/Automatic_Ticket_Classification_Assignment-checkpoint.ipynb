    "\n",
    "You need to build a model that is able to classify customer complaints based on the products/services. By doing so, you can segregate these tickets into their relevant categories and, therefore, help in the quick resolution of the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be doing topic modelling on the <b>.json</b> data provided by the company. Since this data is not labelled, you need to apply NMF to analyse patterns and classify tickets into the following five clusters based on their products/services:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Credit card / Prepaid card\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bank account services\n",
    "\n",
    "* Theft/Dispute reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mortgages/loans\n",
    "\n",
    "* Others\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of topic modelling, you will be able to map each ticket onto its respective department/category. You can then use this data to train any supervised model such as logistic regression, decision tree or random forest. Using this trained model, you can classify any new customer complaint support ticket into its relevant department."

I believed this to be safe as it was through my Chase bank app. I have been with Chase for almost 20 years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful. I am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication. The website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent. In performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through PI it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud. Furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used I believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real XXXX XXXX Chase Bank told me they wouldnt even investigate, report this to XXXX or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter. There isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet! The chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of Chase banking service and as such, imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols. Chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the XXXX tab ... .is most certainly not true. This places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of Chase in the slightest. At minimum the risk of using XXXX on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating I have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him. I also intend to urge My neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using XXXX and XXXX integrated banking apps to the public. I understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as Chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to Be disclosed more throughly. I would not have clicked on the to link to the extent I did if I would have been better informed.',\n",

I\\'ve done many balance transfers in my life, so I have plenty of experience. I recently did a balance transfer with Chase Freedom for {$9000.00} ( did many with other Chase cards, but apparently not \" Freeedom \\'\\' ) When I got my first bill, my minimum payment was {$470.00}. I was SHOCKED. I immediately called on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative told me that the min payment was so high bc they were making me pay the \" Balance transfer fee \\'\\' up front, but my future payments would be around {$90.00}, 1 % of total balance ( which is standard, AND the rate THEY ADVERTISE ) I went to pay the next payment on XX/XX/XXXX & was once again SHOCKED to see my minimum payment was {$440.00}. I paid it, but I have been trying to work this out with Chase ever since. Apparently, the representative was WRONG & I am actually expected to pay 5 %, instead of the standard 1 % they normally charge, bc that was written in my \" user agreement \\'\\' paperwork back in XX/XX/XXXX!! 28 years ago!!! They currently charge 1 % to everyone else in the world. My other cards, including Chase, are all 1 %. This {$440.00} is an unreasonable amt to expect someone to pay for 1 credit card. I have kids & many other bills to pay. They never warned me they were so \" off the charts \\'\\' with their minimum payment percentage, ( except for my original paperwork in XX/XX/XXXX ). They offer everyone else 1 % terms. They change THEIR \" terms \\'\\' anytime it benefits THEM, but won\\'t budge to lower it to make this payment more affordable & reasonable. So, I also asked them ( as soon as I found this out ) to refund my {$360.00} transfer fee so I could use it to transfer the balance to a different card with a more reasonable minimum payment. They refused. I also asked if they would transfer to my CHASE SLATE card, which has 1 % min pmt, they also refused. They will not work with me at all. I am a responsible working person. I would like to preserve my good credit. I could easily transfer again to a different card, but I\\'d have to pay another lump sum of $ again.',\n",

I did that to close out my account roughly {$500.00} payment when I closed out the accounts, and now I get this late payment that showed up on my credit report after 10+ years stating I owe close to {$900.00} dollars. I have never had any payment schedules or notifications in the 10+ years because I paid it off. Upon calling them I am told I need to show proof I paid it off. I would like to think that if indeed I had not paid it off ( which I did ) I would have immediately received late payment notifications.
